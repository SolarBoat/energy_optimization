# Energy Optimization

Modeling the energy budget of a solar-powered boat and planning the motor actuation to maximize the distance traveled.

Classification of the system:

- Discrete time system
- Discretized (finite) state space
- Discretized control set
- time variant
- non-linear

Dynamic Programming approach:
